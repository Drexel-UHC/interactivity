## selectAll- to select all elemets 
### select - to select one element in d3,
so if we have on div we can call select for that div and have multiple items in that div we can do selectAll too select all elments

#### when you use svg (which helps to manipulate data better ), use #attr instead of #style element, and in style we have to use value in a string and add + "px" but if we use #attr we can only write string and it reads as px without even specifying it

## range 
this is where we put smallest vlaue to show case chart lowest point and the highest value to show highest point [0, 100]
