I used #Pie function to convert data into a #Pie  chart form and it also aloots the position of different #Pie

#Arc function,wasused to create each slice of the pie chart. The #innerRadius of the arc is set to 0 and the #outerRadius is set to 200

if change the vlaue of #innerRadius we can achieve donout shape or make a hole in a pie chart

**d3.schemeCategory10** is a color scheme in d3.js using that we can acieve 10 different RGB based colors.
