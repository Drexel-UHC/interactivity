Svelte is a new and modern #JavaScript Framework which is more efficient way to build applications. Unlike traditional #JavaScript frameworks like React, Angular, and Vue, #svelte complies the application code more efficient during build process. This makes #svelte applications faster to load. 

## Key features

- A small bundr size that reduces load times which improves performance
- easy to learn th syntax

## Pros to #React
- Smaller bundle size and faster load times due to the compiler optimizing the code at build time.
- A simpler, more intuitive syntax for writing components and reactive logic.
- Automatic reactivity without using a state management library like Redux or MobX.
- Built-in animation and transition features.
## Cons to #React 

- Smaller community and fewer resources available compared to React.
- Lack of a virtual DOM can make it difficult to optimize performance for complex applications.
- Relatively new framework, with a smaller ecosystem and fewer third-party libraries compared to React.

## #svelte offers lightweight bunder size and faster to develop as compare to #React but react offers more established ecosystem with range of resources but Eventually svelte will have more established resources eventually.
